excerpt: 'In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied to a wide range of safety-critical domains, such as automotive, robotics, and aviation.
Especially the automotive and robotics domains have seen a rapid increase in the number of AI-based systems that are being deployed in real-world applications.
However, real-world applications in the aviation domain are still sparse, given the challenges of AI engineering in combination with strict safety requirements.

A first possible application of AI in the aviation domain might be the future collision avoidance system Airborne Collision Avoidance Systems X (ACAS X).
The goal of collision avoidance systems is to issue advisories to the pilot to avoid near mid-air collisions (NMACs).
The two important variants of ACAS X for this work are ACAS X<sub>A</sub>, providing vertical advisories and meant as a drop-in replacement for current systems in commercial air flight, and ACAS X<sub>U</sub>, providing horizontal advisories for the ever-growing unmanned aircraft systems market.
This work brings both variants closer to real-world deployment by implementing a vertical collision avoidance system, based upon ACAS X<sub>A</sub>, and a horizontal collision avoidance system, based upon ACAS X<sub>U</sub>, for the research flight simulator FlightGear.
Using advisories given by this implementation, this work furthermore provides an auto-avoid function that can command an airplane in FlightGear to safely avoid NMACs.

Finally, this work will show that the ACAS X implementation can avoid collisions in a simulated environment.
For this task, an Operational Design Domain will be defined serving as a basis for safety considerations and evaluating the implementation of the ACAS X.
In the end, simulation-based testing will be used separately for VCAS and HCAS showing the successful utilization of advisory predictions as autopilot inputs.

Summarizing, this work not only presents an open-source implementation of ACAS X<sub>A</sub> and ACAS X<sub>U</sub> for FlightGear but also shows how the generated advisories can be used to successfully avoid NMACs.'
