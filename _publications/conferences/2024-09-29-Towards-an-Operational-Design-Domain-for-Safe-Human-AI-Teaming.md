title: "Towards an Operational Design Domain for Safe Human-AI Teaming in the Field of AI-Based Air Traffic Controller Operations"

excerpt: "Advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) introduce both promising real-world applications in various fields such as aviation but also challenges in assuring safety.
Regulators in aviation mandate, as with any other application, compliance of these AI-based systems with high safety standards.
This especially holds for Human-AI Teaming.
The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) outlined in their concept paper the definitions of cooperation and collaboration between humans and AI, as well as the differences in terms of authority and task allocation.
Therein, the question of safety in situations of collaboration with shared goals, dynamic task allocation, and partial authority within the Human-AI team is paramount.
As a safety concept, EASA requires the usage of Operational Design Domains (ODDs) from the automotive field.

In this work, the concept of ODDs is transferred to the Air Traffic Control (ATC) domain.
An initial ODD is defined for an AI-based digital team partner that supports Air Traffic Controllers in their daily work even for safety-critical tasks such as conflict detection and resolution.
Additionally, the required tools for successfully executing this task is demonstrated.
Based on the ODD description, conflict scenarios are generated and tested in a simulation environment, showcasing situations inside and outside the ODD.
Based on these results, the feasibility of using ODDs in ATC is discussed, outlining a potential step towards the safe application of Human-AI Teaming."
