I am a systems engineer for robotics and automation at the ZAL Center of Applied Aeronautical Research, working on research and development for research projects as well as contract research and support of industrial customers. My focus is on (simulated) robotic systems in hard- and software. This includes novel control strategies for robotic systems based on reinforcement learning.

Before joining the ZAL I studied at the Hamburg University of Technology where I pursued my master's degree (M. Sc.) in Aircraft Systems Engineering focusing on Aircraft Systems, and moreover specializing on control systems, robotics and machine learning. As part of my master's degree, I spent time at the Hybrid Robotics Lab of Asst. Prof. Koushil Sreenath. Here, I was working on autonomous flight control of aerial quadrotors, focusing on developing and implementing novice obstacle avoidance technology for enhancent path planning.

Concurrent to my studies, I was able to prove my knowledge and leadership skills through my work as a working student at Airbus and as a teamleader for a REXUS/BEXUS project, funded by the DLR and ESA.
