## Work experience

* 10/23 - today
  * Research Associate
  * DLR Institute for AI Safety and Security
  * Sankt Augustin, Germany (remote)
  * Researching and developing novel safe and resilient AI systems for the aviation domain. Pursuing my Ph. D. (Dr.-Ing.) in the field of artificial intelligence.

* 10/19 - 08/23
  * Developing Engineer for Artificial Intelligence and robotics
  * ZAL Center of Applied Aeronautical Research
  * Hamburg, Germany
  * Bringing AI into the industry. Working on research and development for research projects as well as contract research and support of industrial customers. Focusing on reinforcement learning and (simulated) robotic systems in hard- and software. Managing governmental funded research projects and representing them at conferences. Building an internal workflow to speed up the training of machine learning algorithms and streamline the deployment of trained models to the edge. Also responsible for writing proposals for government funded projects. Moreover, responsible for managing the in-house robotics simulation server and local GitLab instance.

* 12/16 - 06/18
  * Working Student
  * Cabin Supply Modules A350 (Airbus)
  * Hamburg, Germany
  * Primarily worked as Project Management support for R&D projects concerning new developments within the cabin focusing on Galleys. Especially managing a project which aimed to develop a replacement for the state-of-the-art honeycomb panels. Thus, operated as the focal point for the management, subcontractors, and different divisions across Airbus all working on the project. Therefore, bore the responsibility for multiple deliverables within different projects. Lastly, finished the project by passing TRL 6, hence, allowing Entry-into-Service.

* 09/16 - 01/18
  * Teamleader
  * HAMBURG - a REXUS/BEXUS project (funded by the German Aerospace Center and European Space Agency)
  * Hamburg, Germany; Bremen, Germany; Kiruna, Sweden
  * Led a student experiment for a REXUS/BEXUS project, a German-Swedish student programme in cooperation with DLR and ESA. Been responsible for the entire project, but mostly focused on hard- and software development. Moreover, built the experiment and performed different functional and performance tests afterward. Finally, led and managed a trip to Kiruna, Sweden, on which the experiment was again fully tested and mounted to a balloon, reaching an altitude of 25 000 m.

* 01/16 - 04/16
  * Bachelor's Thesis: Development and Control of a Dive Cell
  * Institute of Mechanics and Ocean Engineering (M-13, MuM), Hamburg University of Technology
  * Hamburg, Germany
  * Designed as well as built an autonomous diving cell as a proof of concept of isobaric stabilization. The diving cell is built around an actuator which was used to change the volume and therefore the buoyancy. Furthermore, for the control laws, investigated different options and finally settled on a PID-controller as a simple solution and a Sliding-Mode-controller as a more advanced solution for comparison.

## Education

* 02/21 - 08/23
  * External Ph. D. (Dr.-Ing.) candidate
  * Hamburg University of Technology
  * Hamburg, Germany
  * Research in the field of reinforcement learning for mechatronic systems. Focusing on the development of novel reinforcement learning algorithms for linear-parameter varying systems to approximate real mechatronic systems to speed up training.

* 10/16 - 09/19
  * Aircraft Systems Engineering, M.Sc.
  * Hamburg University of Technology
  * Hamburg, Germany
  * Pursuing a Master's degree in Aircraft Systems Engineering focusing on Aircraft Systems, and moreover specializing on Control Systems, Robotics and Machine Learning.

* 11/18 - 04/19
  * Visiting Research Scholar
  * University of California, Berkeley
  * Berkeley (CA), United States
  * Researcher in the Hybrid Robotics Lab of Asst. Prof. Koushil Sreenath. Working on autonomous flight control of aerial quadrotors. Focusing on developing and implementing novice obstacle avoidance technology for enhanced path planning.

* 10/12 - 09/16
  * Mechanical Engineering, B.Sc.
  * Hamburg University of Technology
  * Hamburg, Germany
  * Pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering focusing on Aircraft Systems Engineering.
